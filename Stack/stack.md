# Stack


## Introduction


A stack is a linear data structure where elements are stores in the LIFO (Last In First Out) 
principle, where the last element inserted is the first element to be deleted.  
Stack is an **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** and complex data type meaning that it uses other 
data structures for implementation (e.g., Array, Linked List).  


## Stack Basic Operations


### 1. Insertion `push()`:


### 2. Deletion `pop()`:


### 3. Getting Topmost Element `peek()`:


### 4. Verifying The Stack is Full `isFull()`: 


### 5. Verifying The Stack is Empty `isEmpty()`:
